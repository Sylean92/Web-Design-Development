# Web-Design-Development
School Web site projects learning Design, Development and Responsiveness  

To test run my website use the following:

https://rawgit.com/Sylean92/Web-Design-Development-Project1/gh-pages/index.html

Responsive design is for Tablet and Desktop resolution. [phone size wasn't implemented]

PLEASE NOTE:
  By using rawgit.com , it negates the sliders and bugs the opacity over the images.
  The sliders default at the first image [using rawgit.com defaults on image #7] and the arrows allow navigation [using rawgit.com negates navigation]
  
  Sad bugs but haven't found a workaround just yet.
